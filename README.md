> I have been working lately with Wisedoc Inc in pursuit of my interests, contributing to the academic world. We started our mission to empower every student and scholar through an academic software ecosystem. We started off with Journals, thesis, launched alpha but with regards to the current pandemic situation, we heard the people losing their jobs and we strived hard to think in what way we can contribute to the people suffering. This includes current graduates who have spent thousands of dollar for their academics. We thought what could be the best product that we can give from our side as a SaaS to the society. And, we came up with the product Wise-Resume.
Hahaha... there are many softwares out there. What's so special about it? Trust me, it's nothing special apart from User Experience that we provide based upon the problem statements that we observed in the other products. At this moment, that's the best we could give to the society and we are giving it for free. We came out of need in the research world for writing journals, thesis without any effort(not the research though ðŸ˜„). We took a different path and made our reach point to be bit further. We are not sad about it, we are happy that we could give it to the world one or other way.
